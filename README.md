# Drupal Devops

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dbjpanda/drupal-devops.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dbjpanda/drupal-devops)

This project template provides a starter kit for managing Drupal Workflow using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Docker](https://docker.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

You can manage multiple sites like production/development and staging servers through this project, All your environment will setup, install dependencies and Sync Configuration in a single click.

## Requirements

You should have python2.7 installed on your server so that Ansible can use its magic ward to help you in managing Drupal Projects.

# Usage

  Let's see how to use and implement this project kit.

### Step 1 - Clone or Download the current repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dbjpanda/drupal-devops.git <project_name>
```

### Step 2 - Configure env file

**For Server :**

  You need to create `.env` file for each deploying server. It will also be managed by ansible automatically. You need to create `.env.<hostname>` file and add `<hostname>` name in `env_file` variable in host group_var file.

  `cp .env.example .env.<hostname>`

**For Local :**

  Copy .env.example file to .env
  ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
  ```
>Example -

```
  APP_ENV=
  HASH_SALT=

  MYSQL_DATABASE=drupal
  MYSQL_HOSTNAME=mysql
  MYSQL_PASSWORD=<password>
  MYSQL_PORT=3306
  MYSQL_USER=root

  APP_PORT=
  DB_PATH=./db-dump/drupal.sql
  SAVE_PREVIOUS_DB_DUMP=true
  EXPORT_CONFIG_ON_COMMIT=true
  EXPORT_DB_DUMP_ON_COMMIT=true
```

### Step 3 - Configure Ansible inventories and playbooks

**For Server :**

  1. Add hosts name in Ansible Inventory under `ansible/inventories`.

  2. Once inventory hosts are listed, variables can be assigned to them in yml files (in a subdirectory called `group_vars`).

  ```shell
    cp example.yml <hostname>.yml
  ```

  3. Add hosts in existing ansible playbooks, or you can create your custom playbooks and roles.

**For Local :**

  1. Hosts is already added in develop file under inventories with name `local`

  ```
    [local]
    localhost
  ```
  2. Config env vars in `local.yml` file in a subdirectory called `group_vars`

  ```
    backup_dir: '/var/www/backup'
    project_dir: '/var/www/html'
    project_folder_name: 'drupal'
    backup_folder_name: 'drupal-backup'
  ```

### Step 4 - Deployment

  Run ansible-playbooks with the path to the inventory file.

**For Server :**

  Various playbooks are defined in this project, you can deploy as per your requirements.

  ```shell
    ansible-playbook ansible/drupal.production.yml -i ansible/inventories/develop
  ```
  will deploy your drupal site on all the hosts from the inventory file.

**For Local :**

  Run `drupal.local.yml` playbook

  ```shell
    ansible-playbook ansible/drupal.local.yml --connection=local --extra-vars "ansible_sudo_pass=<local-system-password>"
  ```

**Note** : Read more about Ansible playbooks in [Ansible dir](https://github.com/ankitjain28may/drupal-best-practices/tree/master/ansible)

**Note** : Default inventory file is loaded from `ansible.cfg`.

> All the services like php, nginx and mysql are automatically managed by Docker through docker-compose.

**Note** : Read more about Docker and docker-compose in - [Docker dir](https://github.com/ankitjain28may/drupal-best-practices/tree/master/docker)

> All the dependencies are managed using Composer.

## Continous Integration

For Continuous Integration, We are using Travic-Ci.
Each time we pushes through Git, Travis is triggred and checks for Code Quality (Using CodeSniffer) and Unit Tests (Using PHPunit).

You can skip these in `.travis.yml` file by setting `env` variables value.

```
  env:
    BUILD_CHECK_PHPCS: false
    BUILD_CHECK_PHPUNIT: false
    DEPLOY: true
```
**Note** : You can also add your custom testsuites by making changes in `.travis.yml` file.

## Continous Deployment

On Successful Build, Travis will deploy the changes to the server using Ansible. Ansible will connect to server through SSH username and Password. Password will be saved in Travis-CI env variable in a secure mode through Web Interface so that it won't be visible during build.
Password Key should be - `ssh_pass`

It will automatically deploy the changes to your deploying server.

**Note** : Travis configuration will be set in `.env.travis`, `travis`, `travis.yml` and `drupal.travis.prod.yml`. You can add your own custom roles under `roles` and called them from `drupal.travis.prod.yml` playbook for travis configuration.

## Future Implementation

* [ ] Maintaining log file for each deployment using ansible on host server.

* [ ] Opting .env.<hostname> file from setting up through Ansible.
